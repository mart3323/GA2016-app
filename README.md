## GA 2016 app

* **Backend (documents):** Python server \w google drive API
* **Backend (finger rules / signals):** NodeJS server
* **Frontend:** Polymer web app

A web app for use with distributed tablets in the BEST Estonia 2016 General Assembly  
Enables participants to access relevant documents over LAN, as well as raise signals such as 'agree', 'disagree', 'speak louder', etc., or to ask for permission to comment

In practice, we decided not to use the signals because there wasn't enough time to test and i had to babysit the livestream and sound mixer instead. The document server worked fine though.


(If any of the files still contains the passwords - those were autogenerated and temporary)
